        <span style="font-size: 173%">PREFACE.</span></h1>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the principle
        of <span class="tei tei-q">“first know you are right, then go
        ahead,”</span> I have been very slow in making public the results of
        my discovery. But having become thoroughly satisfied that I have a
        reasonable thing of it, have ventured to publish it. It has appeared
        in brief articles in the Galesville INDEPENDENT, in order to invite
        general inspection, and criticism.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When God made man
        to dwell on the face of the earth, He, evidently, must place him
        somewhere. In giving the antldiluvians a description of the creation,
        and first location of man, how mankind corrupted themselves, and how
        God destroyed them with a flood, he simply stated the principal
        facts, and gave a description of the location—and it not being on
        that continent, he could not point it out to them—and as the country
        in which Noah then resided, was all new to him, and his family, no
        one knew where it was; nor was any one able then, or since, to find
        it on that continent; thus, the location, though admitted to be
        somewhere on earth, has been kept a profound mystery to the present
        time, and consequently the innocent cause of no little speculation.
        But by degrees it has been opening to the minds of some, that the
        first habitation of man must have been somewhere on the American
        Continent; and <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page4">[pg 4]</span> the
        finger of time has been plainly pointing to what is known as the
        <span class="tei tei-q">“North West,”</span> as the place. But of
        this last fact I was ignorant when I made the discovery of the
        garden, and commenced developing the facts about it. The discovery,
        resulted from my familiarity with, or thorough knowledge of the
        Bible, and standing on the hanging garden and looking over the plat,
        and admirirg its most wonderful scenery, and counting the rivers, I
        became sensibly impressed by a suggestion, This is the garden of
        Eden: at which suggestion I smiled, as the plat, to me then, was
        altogether too large. Of course I had never given it thought, nor
        measured it up in my own mind to what should, or might be its proper
        dimentions. However so strong were my impressions, that I, as a
        matter of pleasantry, used, occasionally to say to my friends, This
        is the garden of Eden.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Since I commenced
        to publish my views, claiming a possible reality, while some have
        mocked, others are becoming impressed with the idea of its being not
        only possible, but highly probable. Where would a scientest place the
        first pair, to acclimate, and from which to make man, as he now is,
        an inhabitant of all the earth? Not too far north, not too far south.
        Our garden is in that place. It should be destitute of money mineral
        wealth, as these, if easily obtained, are corrupting in their
        tendencies, and should be sought, and toiled for, to be properly
        enjoyed; and should be placed at a distance, just where God says he
        provided it, at the head of the stream. Our garden is still in the
        right place. From inherited <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page5">[pg
        5]</span> wealth and luxury comes danger to the inheritors. Our
        garden is again right. But it should be a place susceptible of, and
        adapted to moral and intellectual growth, and lead to the admiration,
        adoration, and worship of the great Builder of the universe, the
        Infinite and Perfect. Is there a better place for that, in all this
        beautiful earth, than is our garden, and its surroundings? If there
        is, we would like to see it.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I have related the
        facts as they have been presented to me, or as I have discovered
        them, and believe the reader will be pleased and profited with the
        results, and I hope this will lead to more thorough and satisfactory
        investigation.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“And the Lord God planted a garden eastward in Eden. * *
        And a river went out of Eden to water the garden,—[or, the river that
        ran through the land of Eden watered the garden.]—And from
        thence,—[in, the garden]—it was parted and became into four heads. *
        * And the fourth river is Euphrates;”</span> which means long river,
        symbol of greatness and importance, and which, answers to our
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Father of Waters.”</span> It is plain that
        Eden is a certain country; that the Euphrates river crosses that
        country, that <span class="tei tei-q">“eastward”</span>, or on the
        eastward, bank of, or at a certain point on that river, is located
        the garden of Eden; and that three lesser rivers run through and
        water this garden, flowing into the great river; thus four rivers run
        into and water it, but only one, the fourth, runs out. As to how it
        was watered, we have a clue; <span class="tei tei-q">“And Lot lifted
        up his eyes, and beheld all the plain of Jordan, that it was well
        watered everywhere * * even as the garden of the Lord;”</span> by
        streams crossing the plain, and running into the river of Jordon,
        just as our three rivers cross our garden plain, into <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page8">[pg 8]</span> our Euphrates. The names given
        to these rivers were, doubtless, explanations of facts well known to
        the antideluvians.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We need not now
        undertake to prove, or show what must readily be admitted, that,
        there is no such spot, or coming together of rivers in the region
        where it was first supposed to be, and which has caused explorers and
        researchers to turn to Africa, and other countries, in search of the
        place; and Dr. Warren, with all his learning and ingenuity, to the
        North Pole. But <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

        others, can come and see for themselves.</p>

        the <span class="tei tei-q">“eastward bank”</span> of the Mississippi
        River, between the beautiful cities of La Crosse, Wisconsin, and

        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">in the
        world.</span></em> Its valley, proper—with its tributaries, some of
        which reach far out into <span class="tei tei-q">“Havilah”</span> the
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Land of good gold”</span>—extends from the
        Alleghany mountains on the eastern border, 2,000 miles westward to
        the Rocky mountains on the western border, and from the Gulf of
        Mexico, on the south, extending 2,000 miles north, across the United
        States into the Bridtish possessions. This vast area,
        Eden,—containing the most fertile and habitable region of earth, and
        is being settled and inhabited by the most industrious, enlightened,
        christianized and well to-do people in the world; the asylum or
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">universal
        home</span></em> of the oppressed and needy of all lands,—contains
        <span class="tei tei-q">“The heart of the New World,”</span> the
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Land of Promise,”</span> in this Christian
        United <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page9">[pg 9]</span> States of
        America. Central in this domain, Eden, is our <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Garden</span></em> of
        Eden. The soil is not a deep, rich paste, like the American bottoms
        opposite St. Louis, on the same river, which is known to be the
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">richest</span></em> land in the world, but
        higher, drier, and more habitable, easily cultivated, and adapted to
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">gardening.</span></em></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The river here, as
        in most places, has three banks; the first a little above high water
        mark,—densely covered with forest trees, which consitutes the islands
        and <span class="tei tei-q">“river bottoms”</span>—cut up by water
        courses and sloughs. The river and bottoms are about two miles wide,
        over and through which the <span class="tei tei-q">“Laughing”</span>
        and <span class="tei tei-q">“Father of waters,”</span> courses, run,
        and play their dances. The second bank is high and dry above the
        hightest water mark,—and generally smooth prairie, and ready in the
        state of nature for the garden plow—extending back on one or both
        sides of the river for miles, making a valley at this place, of about
        ten miles in the widest, when we reach the bank, bluff, or rocky
        wall, which rises—on each side of our garden—to the altitude of 600
        feet above the river, being the point of the highest bluffs on the
        Mississippi.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Nineteen miles
        above La Crosse, and twelve miles below Winona, on the <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“eastward bank,”</span> nestles, and spreads out that
        most beautiful town site, Trempealeau, on which ought now to be a
        large city, and which doubtless would have been but for the greed and
        ignorance of a part of its original proprietors, who being told, and
        thinking they had the <span class="tei tei-q">“nicest,”</span>
        <span class="tei tei-q">“most beautiful,”</span> <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“splendid,”</span> town site on the Mississippi river,
        they were bound to get rich at once, <span class="tei tei-q">“but not
        knowing <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page10">[pg 10]</span> their
        day,”</span> and how to build up a town like, the fabled dog,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“they grabbed for the shadow and lost the
        reality;”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“Their language was
        confounded and their work delayed.”</span> Here on the second bank,
        is raised, our <span class="tei tei-q">“Hanging Garden,”</span> a
        crescent bluff, high as the outside wall, extending three miles up
        the river, terminating at each end in a point, and one mile through
        the center, being in the form of a new moon, and unlike anything of
        the kind, so far as known, in the entire world, and must be seen to
        be appreciated.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This is not one
        solid smooth topped hill, but possesses all the variety of bluff
        formation, containing groves of forest trees, ravines, slopes,
        scattered rocks, and perpendicular ledges facing the river, like the
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Face of a King,”</span> some of these ledges
        are 200 ft. high, commencing more than half way up the mound, then
        rising perpendicular to near the very top. The top of this hanging
        garden has its slopes, mounds, pyramids, domes, and pinnacles, in
        most beautiful variety; and at the present time, it is dotted with
        fields of grain, and specked with stone quarries and lime kilns. Now,
        please, place yourself with me on the <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Central Outer Dome”</span> <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Heald's quarry,”</span> facing toward the eastward, and
        you have, before, below, and around you the veritable Garden of Eden;
        a valley scene, in extent and importance unequalled in America, and I
        think, in the world. Not like the Yosemite, small, romantic
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">grand</span></em> but <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">uninhabitable</span></em> or unfit for a
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">garden,</span></em> but the very beau ideal of a
        garden.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Now that we are up
        where we can see, let us look across and around this garden.
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page11">[pg 11]</span> Turn, now and
        face the south-west. There, before and below you flows the
        Mississippi, whose name is as euphonious as the Euphrates, or its own
        flowing waters. See its <span class="tei tei-q">“Broad
        channels,”</span> queer and picturesque islands, its trees and
        vine-clad bottoms, lovely beyond description; its general course, not
        meandering, but evenly hugging the base of the Minnesota bluffs, or
        western wall of the garden, which it does for some twenty-five miles,
        or from just below Winona, to just above La Crosse, running in a
        southeasterly and southern direction, making a beautiful curve,
        leaving the main garden valley on the <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Eastward”</span> bank, in the form of a section of an
        ampitheater, 35 miles long, 5 miles wide at each end, and 10 miles
        through the center. <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">This vast valley plain is our Garden of
        Eden.</span></em> Now, Look! as thousands before you have done in
        wonder and surprise! Look immediately around you, over the hanging
        garden on which you stand, and, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">look out for snakes,</span></em> for how could
        you have such a garden without a <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Serpent.”</span>, And this hanging garden has been
        notable and notorious for rattlesnakes, from time immemorial, handed
        down in their Indian name <span class="tei tei-q">“rattlesnake
        hills,”</span> and including Mount Trempealeau, (a separate and
        distinct pyramid) was formerly <span class="tei tei-q">“Literally
        alive with rattlesnakes.”</span> Mr. Dovile, one of the first white
        settlers at Trempealeau, who built his shanty on the bank, a few rods
        from the river, killed, and kept count of ninety great rattlesnakes
        the first season, in, and crossing his foot-path from his house to
        the river, saying nothing of how many he killed
        elsewhere.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page12">[pg 12]</span>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But as Christians
        have taken possession of the hanging garden, the serpents have been
        destroyed, or are disappearing.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The scenery now
        around us surpasses my power of adequate description, as do the great
        lakes. Superior, Michigan, Huron,—and so on down the line,—in their
        magnitude and importance, those little lakes in the garden, southeast
        of us, containing a few acres each, mirroring their shining beauties
        into our faces. But O, how beautifully, and magnificently fenced, or
        walled in, is our garden! While there is a general level, bounding
        the top, yet what an indescribable variety of topping out. Cones,
        oblongs, smooth ridges, trees, huge rocks, rough, ragged and jageed,
        in almost endless variety. Perpendicular ledges boldly facing us: or
        single rocks of varied sizes; smooth bald heads, and ridges; deep,
        and dark chasms; wide openings of river's mouths; all making one of
        the grandest panoramas conceivable. At present this <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“wild scenery”</span> is being effaced by the profuse
        growth of timber. Near the southern extremity, lies the beautiful
        flourishing city of La Crosse, with its tall church spires and
        electric towers, fringed with smoke from its numerous lumber mills;
        most appropriately and providentially named. La Crosse—saying nothing
        of its being the name of an ancient game modernized—as here
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">crosses</span></em> the <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">garden</span></em>
        one of the four notable rivers, whose opening and bluff outline, may
        be seen coming in from the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“far east,”</span></em> making and containing the notable
        and once far-famed, <span class="tei tei-q">“La Crosse
        valley”</span>; on which is located the beautiful city of
        Sparta.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page13">[pg 13]</span>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Just beyond La
        Crosse city, and to the left we see the outline entrance of Mormon
        Cooley valley, which creek bounds the lower end of our garden. Now as
        we trace the wall to the left,—past the La Crosse valley, and first
        eastern gate—we discover another small line of opening through which
        runs Half-way creek, notable as the home (Holman) of Norwegians. The
        next bold heavy prominence is <span class="tei tei-q">“King
        bluff.”</span> Still tracing on, we notice some queer looking rocks,
        lying on top of a ridge; then, the Twin points, the outer one the
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Sugar Loaf,”</span> a most beatiful
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">cone
        mound</span></em> pointed with rock, and beckon to Black river
        valley, this side of which, is <span class="tei tei-q">“Castle
        rock;”</span> and to the left, a wide opening and a beautiful
        valley,—the central and main eastern gate—with branching valleys,
        extending east and northeast, all in front of you, down which flows
        the notable <span class="tei tei-q">“Black river,”</span>
        appropriately named, from the natural blackness of its waters, and
        because it cuts and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">divides</span></em> our <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">garden</span></em>
        through its center, and making a beautiful belt of timbered bottoms.
        As it nears the Mississippi, it forms a delta, one part turning to
        the left, and running parallel to the Mississippi, forming that grand
        booming pond, and depot of lumbering at Onalaska; and then empties
        itself into the Mississippi at LaCrosse; thus inclosing, and forming
        French island, once the resort of counterfeiters.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As you glance up
        Black River valley, coming in from the right, is <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Flemming's creek,”</span> or Lewis' valley, a fertile
        valley, in which is located the euphonious Mendora; those blue
        highlands, apparently at the head of the main valley is <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Robinson's,”</span> or <span class="tei tei-q">“Pine
        Hill,”</span> <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page14">[pg 14]</span>
        between Black River Falls and Sparta. This way to the left, that
        beautiful notch in the bluff is <span class="tei tei-q">“Peacock
        Pass,”</span> and is just this side of North Bend, and though
        apparently so near, is some <span class="tei tei-q">“twenty miles
        away.”</span> This heavy point, at the left of Black river, is
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Heuston's Bluff,”</span> the next best point
        from which to view this valley garden. To the left and farther away,
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">look</span></em> at that <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">great
        rock,</span></em> big as a barn, topping out another cone. That is
        the veritable <span class="tei tei-q">“Decora's Peak,”</span> named
        after that wonderful one-eyed chieftain, who, with a few of his brave
        and loyal band, lodged, occasionally in a cave in that rock; and from
        its hight were enable to discover any game, or even an enemy within a
        large range. Once on a time, it is said, he discovered the prowling
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Black Hawk,”</span> with his band of
        warriors, and ran to Prairie du Chien, ninety miles in one day, to
        inform the U. S. Government; and, then, helped to capture their
        enemy. A little farther to the left, and just across the garden from
        us wedged in a narrow opening, lies the village of Galesville, on
        Beaver creek,—a branch of Black river,—with its exquisitely beautiful
        lake, and bounding fish, its fine water power, health giving mineral
        springs, Galesville University and choice people. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Beautiful for situation”</span> is Galesville, the joy
        of all its inhabitants, if not of all the earth. And <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“as the hills are round about Jerusalem,”</span> so are
        the hills, and vastly more magnificent ones, round about Galesville,
        and the scenery simply GRAND. Looking up Beaver creek valley, to the
        left, is Maughmer's bluff which affords a grand view; and still to
        the left, that dim <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page15">[pg
        15]</span> mountain peak, pointed with rock and shrubs (in the
        direction of Blair, in Trempealeau valley,) is <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Chapel Peak.”</span> In the early settlement, by whites,
        of this region of country, two Methodist itinerants, A. B. Smith and
        Isaac Springer were following a dim wagon track, on their way to
        Galesville, which track passed along at the base of that peak; and
        they clambered to its top, and found there <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“The rock-formed pulpit”</span> or altar, which had stood
        there for ages, into which they entered, and as they were both good
        singers, they sang,—to make the welkins ring, as there was nothing
        else thereto hear:—</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Still tracing the
        garden wall as we turn to the left, we face the <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Big Tamarac”</span> through an opening in the wall, a
        swamp of dense tamarac, one mile wide, and six miles long, bordered
        with belts and groves of oak, furnishing fencing and fuel for the
        upper end of the garden. Another turn and you are looking through
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Whistler's Pass,”</span> another of
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Nature's highways”</span> out of the garden;
        this leading through the Polander settlement into the Trempealeau
        Valley. Another turn and we mark the bluff outline and entrance into
        the garden—the third and last eastern gate,—of the Trempealeau river,
        crossing it at the upper end; and like Black river, it forms a delta,
        one part running down along side of the Mississippi, forming an
        island, on the lower end of which, is that wonderful <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Mount Trempealeau,”</span> a rocky cone covered with
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page16">[pg 16]</span> pine trees, where
        with the outlet of Trempealeau lake, it flows through a narrow
        opening between the mountain and crescent hanging garden—of which it
        forms a part—into the Mississippi river. Trempealeau Lake, at the
        head of the hanging garden, just back of the mountain, is a body,
        principally of spring water, and is one of the most notable fishing
        ponds known, attracting fishermen from far and near. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Trempealeau; surrounded, soaked, fertilized <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">with

        is the word, that the lake, the island, the mountain, the river, the
        county; the township, and the village are all named Trempealeau.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Another slight
        turn and we are looking into the closed up valley of the
        Mississippi,—on account of a bend in the river—which is the fourth
        and last river that enters, crosses, and waters this garden is on the
        west bank of which, at the upper end of our garden, right there,
        plainly before you, lies the charming bustling city of
        Winona,—associated with a thousand legends of Indian traditions,—with
        its tall water tower, its numerous lumber mills, churches, normal
        school, and enterprising people, stretching itself over a smooth and
        most lovely prairie. Vandal proprietors are devouring their
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Sugar Loaf,”</span> standing just back of
        the city, as well as quarrying down their native garden walls.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In our constant
        turning to the left, that string of white buildings below Winona, on
        the river's bank and pressed against the foot of the wall, is Homer,
        a quiet little ville.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In our western
        view we shall not see so many objects of interest; as not a river
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page17">[pg 17]</span> pierces the
        western wall, only a few little brooks, or trout harboring
        runs,—where they used to catch the speckled trout by the bushel,
        prominent among which is Cedar run, just, a little above us and Trout
        run directly opposite of us, on which is located the celebrated
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Pick Wick”</span> flouring mills—are all
        that indent or mar its smooth and even face. Then, everything appears
        to be so near by. The forms, and farm houses, in such multiplied
        variety, so plain in sight, just <span class="tei tei-q">“Over
        there,”</span> <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

        rugged, to where <span class="tei tei-q">“Fallen Humanity”</span> was
        driven. And we are getting tired of looking, so we make a rapid turn,
        glancing along the wall down over New Amsterdam and Holland
        settlement, to the point of commencement, and are looking into the
        closed-up valley, on account of another bend, in this mighty, mighty,
        Mississippi river, in its exit out of this <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Garden of
        Eden.</span></em></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As we look down
        once more on this valley garden land, with its little silver lakes,
        and shining streams, beautiful groves and undulating prairies, and
        try to peer into its future, we are completely overwhelmed with
        emotion, as we notice it is just <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">beginning</span></em>
        to be checkered up, by marks of intelligent human occupancy, as well
        as by the Indian tepee and wigwam. But the time of gardening is not
        yet. And here is room for hundreds of thousands of the fallen sons of
        God, to come and regain a home in this <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Paradise on earth”</span> to all such as have a Paradise

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">From our past
        observation, it is not so very strange to us, that individuals often
        pass along over important sections of earth with out noticing its
        beauty and its glory. Not that its flowers and its fruits are
        altogether hidden, but that they have become common place, or for
        lack of attention, on account of preoccupancy of the mind, are not
        noticed. Nor is it much wonder that individuals should reside right
        in the midst of the garden of Eden and not be aware of it; see many
        of its peculiar characteristics, and yet not recognize them; simply
        because they seem natural; were indeed natural; just as God made it;
        or, the results of natural growth and changes. It is perfectly plain
        from the Bible account, and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">that</span></em> is our guide in this matter,
        that Eden was a country, and that a very important river crossed or
        ran through and watered that country, and because of its importance
        was named Euphrates.—the great river, a very common ancient method of
        naming things.—And that, <span class="tei tei-q">“Eastward,”</span>
        or on the eastward bank of that river, central in this Eden, at a
        certain point,—where three rivers joined the great river, the four
        entering, and crossing the garden, and only the great river running
        out of it,—was located the garden of Eden; <span class="tei tei-pb"
        id="page19">[pg 19]</span> <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">One</span></em> of the most desirable places for
        a human being to dwell. Conducive of human happiness: First, where
        there was a plenty of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">good water,</span></em> for human uses, and to
        fertilize the land, also for fishes and fowls, and yet exempt from
        malarial diseases. And we ask, where can there be found another plat
        of earth, of the same size and surroundings, so abundantly watered,
        and with all the requisites for a garden, and yet so free from
        malaria, as is our garden of Eden. Second, far enough north to catch
        the dry, balmy, health inspiring atmosphere, and the pure water, the
        native home of the speckled trout, and yet the summer temperature of
        the mild temperate zone, a medium from which to send its inhabitants
        north and south. Third, exemption from the great terrors of mankind,
        earthquake and cyclone. While the mountains are far away <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“round about”</span> our Eden, and the minerals in great
        abundance and variety are within and about it, yet so far removed are
        they from the garden, as entirely to exempt it from earthquakes; as
        these are confined to sea coasts, and gas producing regions. And as
        cyclones are supposed to be produced by the sun's rays,—as they never
        occur in the night,—and peculiar electric concentration, which
        requires uniformity of land, or region, and heat, and as our garden
        is sunk down into the earth to the depth of 500 feet, and in a line
        or direction, requiring a cyclone to cross it at right angles,—as
        their course is from the south of west, toward the north of east—and
        thus would have to leap the chasm, or loose its force in tumbling
        into it,—and such is the uneveness <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page20">[pg 20]</span> of the country around it as to lessen
        liability—for a cyclone is simply an electric wind storm, and not a
        thunder storm, and moves in a single cloud, and not spread abroad,
        and would be broken by an uneven country; find also on account of the
        evaporation arising from the <span class="tei tei-q">“much
        water”</span> of our garden, such an electric heated current could
        not well be formed across it; so we are naturally exempt from
        cyclone, as well as earthquakes, which must be a great relief of
        mind, and source of enjoyment to our residents. Yet from its size,
        and shallowness, we must still be subject to high and purifying
        winds, and rain storms. And as evaporation and consequently the
        conducting of electricity from the earth to the cloud regions, must
        go on more rapidly in our garden, on a hot day, because of its
        <span class="tei tei-q">“much water,”</span> so, doubtless, we shall
        always have our full quota of thunder storms. The rains, however,
        being generally, of the more steady and general character.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To the language of
        Bishop Foss in his article on Minnesota, just published in the
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Christian
        Advocate:</span></em><span class="tei tei-q">“From my vantage ground
        of observation, near the center of the continent, I greet you and
        many of your readers on its distant rim;”</span> we just wish to add,
        that our garden of Eden is bounded on the west by southern Minnesota,
        therefore central. Again, <span class="tei tei-q">“My point of
        observation is lofty as well as central. Minnesota occupies the most
        elevated plateau between the Gulf of Mexico and Hudson Bay, and forms
        the watershed of three great river systems of the central part of
        North America—the Mississippi, <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page21">[pg 21]</span> the St. Lawrence, and the Red River of the
        North—its average elevation being just about 1,000 feet, the highest
        point 1,600 feet.”</span> Again, <span class="tei tei-q">“Concerning
        the climate, I condense the statement of the <span class=
        "tei tei-title"><span style="font-style: italic">Encylopedia
        Britanica:</span></span> Its elevation above sea-level gives an
        agreeable rarefaction to the atmosphere, and makes the prevalence of
        fogs and damp weather unknown. The comparative dryness of the
        atmosphere neutralizes the severest effect of excessive cold. The
        Smithsonian Chart assigns to Minnesota an average temperature for the
        hottest week in summer of from 85° to 90° and for the coldest week in
        winter from 10° to 20° below zero. The average annual rainfall is
        about 25½ inches. It is evident that the causes which mitigate the
        actual severity of the climate as felt, and so many clear days * *
        are those which render a climate healthful in the highest
        degree.”</span> What is thus true of Minnesota, is pre-eminently so
        of our Garden.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">While there is in
        our garden nearly every grade of soil, from the sand blow-out, to the
        richest black muck, yet it is principally sandy loam, just the
        foundation, for a garden. Still it produces fairly all kinds of
        grain.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In our early
        settlement, over thirty years ago, Deacon Gilbert, raised, near
        Galesville, fifty-two bushels of wheat to the acre; and it was
        reported of some one raising 60. On a farm, located midway between
        the hanging garden and the opposite wall, purchased by D. O. VanSlyke
        from the government—as <span class="tei tei-q">“Hopkins
        choice,”</span> or the refuse vacant land, and last to be entered on
        the prairie, or entire upper end of the garden,—when, at its
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page22">[pg 22]</span> best, produced
        forty bushels of wheat to the acre. And as one forty was devoted to
        wheat, several crops were taken, averaging over 35 bushels to the
        acre; then gradually decreasing to the fifteenth crop, one having
        been of corn, and fourteen of wheat, without the application of any
        fertilizers whatever, when it produced only 18 bushels of No. 1 wheat
        to the acre. These facts came within my own observation, and are
        probably, above the average of the entire garden; as the assessors
        assessed this farm, for a number of years at nineteen dollars per
        acre, when it was offered for sale at fifteen dollars per acre. But
        Trempealeau Prairie has been notable for many years as the
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Egypt”</span> for corn producing. And we
        have no way of estimating what could be done in the line of
        gardening, for lack of a market, or capitalists to successfully enter
        competition. But as to the apple-tree, that appears to have been
        driven out with fallen man; and whether redeemed man can restore it,
        is a question, as it is not designed at present, for man to live on
        the spontaneous productions of the earth.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Moritz Engel of
        Dresden-Newstadt, Germany, has written a book, an octavo of 207
        pages, dated Adam's and Eve's day, December 1884, entitled:
        <span class="tei tei-q">“The Solution of the Paradise
        Question.”</span> To a review of this book, President W. J. Warren of
        the Boston University, has devoted over a column in the Christian
        Advocate of Aug. 20, 1885. Engel claims to demolish, and doubtless
        does, the preceding <span class="tei tei-q">“eighty nugatory attempts
        at a solution.”</span> And as anyone can see, Dr. Warren demolishes
        Engel's attempt to foist his riverless <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Tartarian swale in the heart of the North Syrian
        desert,”</span> as the veritable Eden; in the lower end of which was
        his Garden, alternating between a pool or lake, caused by the rains,
        and filled by the torrents during the <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page25">[pg 25]</span> rainy season, and a dried up, parched, barren
        spot, drying up, <span class="tei tei-q">“towards the end of May, or
        first of June; without a green thing,”</span>—utterly
        uninhabitable,—and which Engel admits, <span class="tei tei-q">“has
        always been so.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The chief value of
        Engel's production, as well as Dr. Warren's North Pole Garden, is to
        show, (in Dr. Warren's own language.) <span class="tei tei-q">“The
        imperishable interest of the Eden problem;”</span> and to leave the
        subject entirely clear for me, and a calm consideration of the facts
        of the case as we find them. Dr. Warren, naturally, (as anyone who
        undertakes to do a thing and fails,) scouts the idea of anyone else
        doing it, or of a litteral four rivered; Garden of Eden. So have
        others who have failed to find it.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Engel puts in a
        claim of Divine inspiration directing him to the spot; and he writes
        with the positiveness and unreasonableness of a crank. All the
        inspiration we claim, is the beauty and grandeur of the scenery, and
        the adaptation and facsimile, or actual description of the spot, to
        the description given in the Bible, a Divinely inspired book, as our
        guide to it.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We are aware that
        we are living in an age of scientific speculation, of counterfeits,
        and humbugs. After misguided explorers have given up the search, in
        the Eastern Continent, a scientest, to show his skill, must throw a
        cloud on the possibility of finding a literal <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“four rivered spot,”</span> on earth, and gives us an
        ingenious unaproachable North Pole Garden. A crank gives us a
        volcanic <span class="tei tei-q">“Tartarian,”</span> riverless desert
        as the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

        place, to entice purchasers to his lands. Now, providentially, we are
        clear of all these objections. We do not have an unapproachable,
        frozen sea; or Tartarian volcanic region; or malarial swamp; or
        government, or company, lands to sell. Our Garden is principally
        owned by actual settlers. All the land I own, is a burial lot in the
        Galesville cemetery, and not for sale; and not many have money enough
        to purchase it.</p>

        youuthfulness of the region immediately around our Garden. Take about
        a hundred miles square,—of which our Garden is the centre,—and you
        will have some of the most charming mountain and valley scenery in
        the world, minus the mountains, or all in miniature, just such hills
        and valleys in which the youth most delight. A more appropriate
        region to surround the Garden we cannot conceive. While immediately
        outside of this region you enter upon a broad level country,
        principally prairie, of rich farming lands, indicating the next step
        in developed humanity, and the very beau ideal of an Eden; and as you
        go outward, the earth abounds in minerals, and in unlimited sources
        of wealth. Take a map of Palestine giving a birds-eye view of the
        hills and valleys, of which Jerusalem is somewhat central, and you
        will have a fair representation or view of the region around our
        Garden, and see the force of the expression, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“as the hills are round about Jerusalem, so is the Lord
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page27">[pg 27]</span> round about his
        people,”</span> and so are the hills round about our Garden.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Did you say as you
        looked down over our Garden valley, that this is too large a plat of
        ground for the Garden of Eden? Bless you! have you not considered
        that the Garden should be proportionate to the Land of Eden? Why, did
        you think that the Garden of Eden was only a half-acre garden patch,
        or small orchard? Read again your Bible on that subject. How could
        you get four rivers into it then, to water it, and one of them a
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Euphrates”</span> a wonderful great river?
        And is not the usual idea of a garden, a beautiful rich flat, or
        valley, like Lot's plain of Jordan? Please just think again, how God
        had created the whole earth for the habitation of the human family,
        and would he stint the allotment of the first pair? Did you think how
        long they lived, how many children they probably had, what a numerous
        family before the first pair died, numbering into the ten thousands?
        Did you ever give thought to the plan of settlement, of these
        children? Of the necessity of water thoroughfares, and the wisdom of
        God in locating them in some grand centre, as is this garden, in this
        central, wonderful water-shed in this Eden as already shown,
        comprising the great centre of this continent; and that when this
        garden should be well filled with inhabitants, by means of boats, and
        easy water conveyance, they could easily branch out and make
        settlements along the rivers? Can you grasp the mightiness of
        Jehovah's plan, in locating the first pair at the junction of so many
        rivers into one so great a river, and central to this Eden; thus
        naturally <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page28">[pg 28]</span> and
        easily to extend the settlements over so vast a region of excellent
        country, as this Eden—the greatest half of a continent,—and all this
        before the invention of wagon roads and railroads. Please give it
        wise thought, before deciding it so quickly.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Did you pugh!
        pugh! at the idea of the garden, and antdieluvian settlements, being
        so far away from Mt. Ararat? An ingenious Yankee, F. H. Kribs, has
        figured that out long ago; that the ark would naturally go eastward,
        and would just about reach that mountain in the time it was floating;
        and that the current ran eastward is proven by the eastward direction
        of submerged antediluvian trees. Then, how natural that God should
        remove the redeemed ones far away from the scenes and remembrances of
        human corruption and abominations before the flood; and let him
        develop <span class="tei tei-q">“up anew,”</span> in the midst of new
        scenes and surroundings, and, as it were, in a <span class=

        his being, to allow, by slow stages, to return him to the place of

        representations of such a variety of living objects, so plentiful in
        and around this garden, and scattered throughout the country of Eden,
        on one of which we are now standing? There was science and durability
        in their construction. Did he say they were built by the
        mound-builders? Evidently; but who are the mound-builders? That is
        not in history or tradition. The first who came here after the flood,
        found the mounds here, and asked the question: who are the
        mound-builders? The mound-builders <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

        declaring that I must be mistaken in my locality of the Garden of
        Eden, for lack of the presence of a personal devil? In retort, I am
        compelled to say, that I was sent a missioniary to this region, over
        thirty years ago, and that I found the devil, or his tools, then
        predominating in the M. E. society here; and when we tried to

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In giving the
        description of the Garden of Eden, does the Bible, there, or
        anywhere, say so, or is there any grounds to believe, or suppose that
        it was written or printed in legible imperishable characters, on the
        walls around, on the sky above, or on conspicuous places within the
        garden, <span class="tei tei-q">“This is the Garden of Eden?”</span>
        If not, what is our guide? Evidently not a Lo here, or a Lo there,
        but the plain description, fairly interpreted, and the place that
        answers that description; and we have it. Now, the public press of La
        Crosse, and Winona, within the borders of our garden and who might be
        supposed to know the merit, or demerit of my claim, have not
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page31">[pg 31]</span> deigned to notice
        my articles on the Garden of Eden; so they cannot be accused of
        conspiring with me to mislead the public, to attract to their cities;
        or of having any faith in my discovery; and yet, I challenge any of
        them to show any material incorrectness of my description and
        statements.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Once, when on a
        steamboat, coming up the Mississippi, through our garden, and
        standing forward, on the upper deck, near a well dressed gentleman,
        who was intently looking at and admiring scenery which had also
        attracted my attention, he turned suddenly, and excitedly said,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“See! (pointing) O see, that most
        enchantingly lovely scene, there!”</span> (as if he had never before
        seen its equal.) <span class="tei tei-q">“There, if an artist should
        paint that, they would say, <span class="tei tei-q">‘That is purely
        imaginary; the result of fancy’</span>; but <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">there</span></em> is
        the foundation and excitement to his art; and no known artist can
        measure up to the reality.”</span> Perhaps neither of us will ever
        again see so enraptureing a scene of clouds, shades, lights and
        shadows, of bluff scenery,—and that means something here—of beautiful
        islands and forest trees, as was just then around us, and mirrored to
        us in that grand old looking-glass, on whose placid waters we were
        then floating. Being of like sympathy, I entered into conversation
        with him, when he kindly informed me, that, to gratify his passion
        for scenery, he had traveled extensively in the old world, or foreign
        countries, that he was now taking in the Mississippi River, and that
        this was the most beautiful and attractive river scenery he had ever
        seen in his life; and that it far surpassed anything they had seen in
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page32">[pg 32]</span> the old world. I
        have had several similar statements of noted travelers, enough, with
        what I have seen myself, to satisfy me of the truthfulness of my
        claim. I have taken several acknowledged eminent travelers to my
        first point of observation, (Healds Bluff) who invariably, like
        myself, evidently, labored, and failed for language adequately to
        express the overwhelming beauty and grandeur of this valley scene.
        Now, if ours is not the veritable original Garden of Eden, it is
        certainly easy of access, of increasing reputation and importance as
        a summer resort, and open to investigation, and we challenge the
        strictest inspection. Come and see! Come and see!</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I am glad to learn
        from the Editor of the Independent that I am not the first one who
        has <span class="tei tei-q">“located the old Bible ground in the
        Northwest;”</span> would like very much to see the volume alluded to,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“written fifty years ago,”</span> treating
        that subject. Perhaps we might gain some information from one who had
        given it close intelligent thought, as well as some very desirable
        information on this somewhat mysterious subject. Mine was an entire
        new thought to me, suggested by the actual sight, viewing the garden
        from a point on the hanging garden, and studying it over and over
        during my residence here of over thirty years. And despite of my
        natural skepticism, I have become so impressed with the striking
        resemblance or exact likeness of this, to the Bible garden, as
        therein, described, and the immediate surroundings of this, to
        Palestine, (the type of the surrounding or original habitation of
        man) as to force me to admit the possibility, and to write out my
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page33">[pg 33]</span> convictions for
        the benefit of some one better informed, and to enable such a one to
        draw better conclusions.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When God formed
        the earth into a globe, and set it rolling to keep it so, and started
        it in its orbit around the sun, and the light of the sun first
        flashed upon it, producing the requisite light and motion, for
        marking time, then, with half in light and half in shade, as round
        the sun earth took its flight, time on earth began. The day, the
        month, the year. Chronological time commenced on the first day at
        high 12, and <span class="tei tei-q">“The evening and the morning
        [ending on the second day at high 12, one complete diurnal revolution
        of the earth] was the first day.”</span> And as man was the only
        intelligent being placed on earth, capable of noting time, his
        residence was, evidently, on that central line. Our <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“long”</span> river and garden of Eden, is exactly there,
        on the 90th meridian of central time, as laid down on our present
        time table maps for this continent.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As everything in
        creation was full and perfect, God wisely placed the earth in the
        summer solstice point of its orbit, and this continent facing the
        sun, so that when he placed man upon it, as to give him the benefit
        of harvest, and correct time, and all of which is proved by the
        change, God ordered, from original reckoning of time, when Israel
        left Egypt, Ex. 12, 2, <span class="tei tei-q">“This month [Abib, the
        7th month] shall be unto you the beginning of months, it shall be the
        first month of the year to you.”</span> Thus changing the beginning
        of the year from mid-summer to mid-winter. The commencing of the
        reckoning of the day <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page34">[pg
        34]</span> has also been changed from mid-day to midnight. That the
        original first month, now the 7th month, was harvest time, is proved
        from Lev. 23, 9-39; and that the seasons, of summer and winter, were
        then as now, is also proven by Gen. 1, 14, and the history of the
        clothing of the first pair, first aprons, then skins and furs.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The names given to
        the rivers and places, in connection with the original habitation of
        man, were naturally washed out by the flood, or their recollection
        continued in names of similar places on the new continent. Then, is
        it not somewhat remarkable that, our garden valley is in the form of
        a beautiful dove, or bird of paradise; and so grandly walled in as to
        appear as a single valley, and have a hanging garden so situated that
        from its height, the whole valley, the rivers, and <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“much water”</span> all in plain sight.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Is it not a little
        strange that the Holy Land should be the counterpart of the regions
        around our garden, only ours, geologically, a little older, and at
        present, at least, vastly superior in productiveness and desirability
        as a home; and that so many things, in connection with and in
        addition to, the exact Bible description of the garden of Eden, and
        of the Holy Land, point to this place as the original garden; oldest,
        and best adapted place on earth for the commencement of human
        existence, and from which naturally to branch out, filling the
        Palestine around it; then, over the entire Eden as already described.
        Let me once more call your attention to the region immediately around
        our garden, of a section of which we have such a good <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page35">[pg 35]</span> view from this Heuston's
        Muff, of beautiful hills and valleys, similar in appearance and
        extent, to the land of Palestine; which was selected by the Creator
        as a representation of the habitation of man on earth, in its
        pristine glory; a beau ideal of a country, a paradise; a region of
        supreme felicity and delight; <span class="tei tei-q">“A land flowing
        with milk and honey;”</span> which means susceptibility of the
        highest earthly enjoyments, and figure of the world to come. Such a
        rough, youthful country, is not naturally subject to cyclones, and
        disastrous storms, <span class="tei tei-q">“but of rains,”</span> and
        <span class="tei tei-q">“green pastures;”</span> not a land of
        malaria, but a land of health and happiness. Palestine was central to
        the habitable part of the eastern continent, and was thus, in
        connection wilh its other good qualities, selected for the residence
        of God's chosen people, and contained many of the mountains on which
        God appeared to man, a very interesting chapter in the history of
        that country. Then, the central location of Jerusalem, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“the city of the great King;”</span> <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Beautiful for situation, the joy of the whole earth, is
        Mount Zion;”</span> in which was built the Holy Temple—of which God
        himself was architect—with its Holy of Holies, where God met the High
        priest, and kept up, though somewhat broken, yet, for long periods,
        special communication with man, thus making it a holy and God honored
        spot. There the Jews used to point to a stone, set as they claimed,
        by some miraculous power, in the precise centre of the world. But
        whether this was so or not, the city was for a long time the centre
        of attraction of the world's commerce, and of the best form of
        religion.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page36">[pg 36]</span>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“A land flowing with milk and honey.”</span> Yes, and
        that we have the place we hope to make appear by a few extracts from
        a speech delivered by T. D. Lewis, before the Wisconsin Dairymen's
        Association, at Arcadia, Trempealeau County, Wisconsin, February,
        1885, published by the Dairymen's Association. Mr. Lewis, not knowing
        of our garden and Palestine, spoke only in reference to what is
        beginning to be recognized, and well known facts in relation to the
        dairying interests of this region. Commencing on page 76:
        <span class="tei tei-q">“As good, natural grasses and plenty of the
        right kind of water are the material requisites necessary to
        successful dairying or stock-growing generally, I propose to discuss
        in a brief manner, and for the first time, call the attention of the
        public to the peculiar quality of the soil in this section, and its
        adaptability for successful grass growing, especially clover, and of
        its action, through the grasses and water, in producing a superior
        quality of butter. * * * * It is now, I believe, generally conceded
        by all stock growers that there is no known plant grown that requires
        so small an outlay of labor and expense generally, and furnishes so
        great an amount of plant food of just the right kind for producing
        the best butter, cheese, and good, quickly fattened beef, as clover,
        where it can be grown with anything near success. * * * * * * My
        attention was first attracted to this subject some eight or ten years
        ago, by noticing spots along the roads where clover had sprung up in
        small patches, in soil either wild, or but, at the most, partially
        subdued. I observed that it <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page37">[pg
        37]</span> grew in the most luxuriant manner, and spread rapidly, did
        not winter kill; in fact, looked just as if it had come to stay. I
        then began a thorough examination of the soil that I have not yet
        entirely completed, but have ascertained enough to warrant me in
        saying, that through the agency of the decomposition of an ancient
        stratum of rock, of which the most of our argillaceous clays are
        composed in this vicinity, I find we have a soil peculiarly adapted
        to the growth of clover. * * * * * * What were the reasons, do you
        suppose, why the Arcadia creamery butter took the first, and the Alma
        creamery the second premium at the fair held at St. Louis last fall?
        This was from butter made in Arcadia the second, and in Alma the
        first season of their opperation. You could not believe, for a
        moment, that the butter makers employed in these two creameries were
        so much better than all the others that exhibited butter at that
        time, that this was the cause of obtaining the premiums? I find,
        also, that the Arcadia butter, when placed upon the Elgin market of
        Illinois, is considered superior to the other butter, in all the
        qualities that go to make up a first-class article, and that is the
        largest butter market, outside of Chicago, in the state. You would
        most certainly assign this cause to other and more correct reasons,
        and, by an investigation into the facts, would find it was produced
        through the effects of this peculiar chemical material, in its action
        through the grasses and water of this region. * * * *Any one looking
        on Prof. Owens' geological chart of his government survey of
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page38">[pg 38]</span> this state and
        Minnesota, will see a small area, colored and marked metamorphic
        shades. It is no great extent of territory, includes this and Buffalo
        county, and a portion of Jackson, and about us much in Minnesota. It
        has been badly cut up through the agencies of erosion, corrosion, and
        denudation, and probably one-fourth of this area is now composed of
        arenaceious valleys, practically inexhaustible.”</span> Clover
        fields, <span class="tei tei-q">“flowing with milk and honey,”</span>
        how appropriate. A Wisconsin Dairyman took the first premium on
        butter at the Worlds fair, at Philedelphia, in 1876; at the World's
        Exposition at New Orleans, in 1880, in dairy products, Wisconsin,
        Iowa and Minnesota stands at the head; and the head centre of which,
        when once developed, is our palestine. In cheese products, at New
        Orleans, out of 84 premiums, Wisconsin took 71, amounting to $2,838.
        On butter, out of 69 premiums, Iowa, Minnesota and Wisconsin took 54,
        amounting to $3,364, thus leading the world.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus who can
        predict the future greatness of our garden, and the region around it;
        naturally exempt from cyclone—which is beginning to be one of the
        great terrors of man-kind—as it would require a miracle to leap a
        cyclone from the top of our southwestern wall, down 600 feet, on to
        the broad Mississippi river—and into a decidedly different
        atmosphere, the reason already given—and keep a whirling. Thirty
        years of observation has taught me, that small, single storms pass
        around us, and larger ones, often, divide, and, no matter how
        portentous they look, as did the one the other day—since the St Cloud
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page39">[pg 39]</span> cyclone—which, at
        first sight, approaching from the southwest, at the right time of
        day, and frightful blue black color, made the timid ones tremble: but
        on approaching the garden, it naturally divided, and passed around
        us, as usual; thus confirming our statement.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Not being a
        believer in the speculative vague theories of modern geologists, I
        shall leave the discussion of the geological age of our garden to
        those wiseacres. But simply notice, that according to standard
        authorities, our hanging garden contains the veritable Potsdam sand
        stone of the primordial age. And my stone door step, taken from
        another strata, is a mass of Molusk shells of the tribe of
        Brachiopods—specimens of the earliest life on earth—the shells
        <span class="tei tei-q">“less in size than a finger nail;”</span>
        (see Dana's geology page 81) related to the modern Lingula; thus
        composing a Lingula flag, or Lingula sandstone, of which mine is a
        slab over 5 feet long, 2 feet wide and six inches thick, the finest
        specimen I have ever seen, and lies at my front door, free for
        inspection.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus, on the
        oldest continent, with an overwhelmingly rich, great, grand Eden;
        watered by the <span class="tei tei-q">“Uphrates,”</span> (long
        river) which, in itself, is superlative; and which, with its
        tributaries, waters a superlatively grand portion of the earth; and
        with its central garden, and surpassingly grand hanging gardens,
        which overtop, and as immeasurably transcend the hanging gardens of
        Babylon—which tourists travel thousands of miles to see—as does the
        Niagra Falls, a common creek mill pond, or as the works of nature
        transcend <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page40">[pg 40]</span> the
        works of art. And did not God know which was the longest river on
        earth, and which, with its tributaries, watered the grandest region

              computers. It exists because of the efforts of hundreds of

              freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
              Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a
              secure and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
              generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Project
              Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without wide spread
              public support and donations to carry out its mission of
              increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that
              can be freely distributed in machine readable form accessible
              by the widest array of equipment including outdated equipment.
              Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important
              to maintaining tax exempt status with the IRS.</p>

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The
              Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
              charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the
              United States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it
              takes a considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to
              meet and keep up with these requirements. We do not solicit
              donations in locations where we have not received written
              confirmation of compliance. To SEND DONATIONS or determine the
              status of compliance for any particular state visit <a href=

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">While we
              cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
              have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no
              prohibition against accepting unsolicited donations from donors
              in such states who approach us with offers to donate.</p>

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
              International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot
              make any statements concerning tax treatment of donations
              received from outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp
              our small staff.</p>
